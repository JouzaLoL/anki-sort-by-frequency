# anki-sort-by-frequency
Small Node.js script to sort an Anki collection by word frequncy.
Default frequency DB is for English, [source](https://github.com/hermitdave/FrequencyWords/). You can make and use your own frequency DB, just follow the format of the default one.

To convert your decks/collection to JSON, you can use [this Anki addon](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1589071665).
